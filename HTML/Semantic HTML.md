# Semantic HTML

### What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML uses HTML elements that convey meaning, both to developers and browsers. Instead of using generic elements like \<div> and \<span>, semantic tags like \<header>, \<footer>, and \<section> clarify the structure of the content.

### Why It Matters: The Evolution of HTML

Early HTML (Pre-HTML5):

- Relied on \<div> and \<span> for layout.
- Made web pages difficult to read for both humans and machines.

Introduction of HTML5 (2014):

- Added semantic elements like \<header>, \<footer>, \<article>, etc.
- Promoted cleaner and more accessible code.
- Improved machine readability and accessibility for users.

## Benefits of Semantic HTML

### Accessibility

- Assistive technologies like screen readers
  understand document structure with
  semantic tags.
- Tags help screen readers identify sections,
  enhancing the experience for users with
  disabilities.

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

- Semantic tags help search engines interpret
  content structure and importance.
- Tags like \<article> and \<header> improve
  content hierarchy and rankings.
- \<main>, \<nav>, \<header>, and other elements
  enhance context and relevance for search
  engines.

### Clean Code Structure

- Semantic elements organize code logically,
  making it easier to read and maintain.
  Developers can quickly identify content
  sections, reducing coding errors and
  improving collaboration across teams.
